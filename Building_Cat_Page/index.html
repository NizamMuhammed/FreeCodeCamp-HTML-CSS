          The cat (Felis catus), commonly referred to as the domestic cat or
          house cat, is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae.
          Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the
          domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC.<br /><br />
          It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges
          freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans
          for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Because of its
          retractable claws, it is adapted to killing small prey like mice and
          rats. <br /><br />It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes,
          sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well
          developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a
          crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations like
          meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as
          cat body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in
          frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It also
          secretes and perceives pheromones.
