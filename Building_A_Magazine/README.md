7. CSS Grid //offers a two-dimensional grid-based layout, allowing you to center items horizontally and vertically while still retaining control to do things like overlap elements.
8. grid-template-columns //make the grid display to columns
9. minmax function //to make your columns responsive on any device. The minmax function takes two arguments, the first being the minimum value and the second being the maximum.
10. row-gap //To add space between rows in the grid layout
11. repeat() //function is used to repeat a value, rather than writing it out manually, and is helpful for grid layouts
12. grid-column //specifies a grid item's size and location in a grid layout, and is a shorthand property for the following properties:
    grid-column-start, grid-column-end
13. grid-column -1 //where you are unsure of how many columns your grid will have, but you want an element to stop at the last column.
14. grid-auto-flow //takes either row or column as the first value, with an optional second value of dense. grid-auto-flow uses an auto-placement algorithm to adjust the grid layout. Setting it to column will tell the algorithm to create new columns for content as needed. The dense value allows the algorithm to backtrack and fill holes in the grid with smaller items, which can result in items appearing out of order.
15. grid-auto-columns //override the default column width set to _auto_
16. letter-spacing //give space between letters or alphabets
17. ::first-letter // allows you to target the first letter in the text content of an element
18. list-style-type //property specifies the type of list item marker, the bullet point.
19. gap //property is a shorthand way to set the value of column-gap and row-gap at the same time
20. place-items //property can be used to set the align-items and justify-items values at the same time
