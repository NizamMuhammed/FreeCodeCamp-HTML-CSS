📖 I embarked on this tutorial with the intention of refreshing my memory,💡 but it has proven to be a gateway to deeper insights into the world 🌐 of **front-end design** 🖥️. I have expanded my knowledge significantly, touching upon topics such as _animations, accessibility considerations, grid systems, and pseudo-selectors._

This will serve as a valuable reference for _myself_ and **others** in the future. 🚀
