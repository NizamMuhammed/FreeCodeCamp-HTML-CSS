I embarked on this tutorial with the intention of refreshing my memory, but it has proven to be a gateway to deeper insights into the world of # **front-end** design. I have expanded my knowledge significantly, touching upon topics such as _animations, accessibility considerations, grid systems, and pseudo-selectors._

This will serve as a valuable reference for _myself_ and **others** in the future.
