1. Variables // Variable declarations begin with two dashes (-) and are given a name and a value like this: --variable-name: value;
2. To use a variable, put the variable name in parentheses with var in front of them like this: var(--variable-name)
3. fallback value //The property will use the fallback value when there's a problem with the variable. var(--variable-name, fallback-value)
